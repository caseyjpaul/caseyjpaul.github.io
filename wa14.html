<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Do you have a chance at winning Survivor?</h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Jupyter Notebook</p>
<p>One way I would present this data would be through a Jupyter Notebook. The intended audience would be people who are more data oriented because then they could modify my code and figure out their own insights. They might also be able to make more visuals than I did and I think that would be really beneficial. I also think data analysts for TV shows or TV channels would find this beneficial because they could see datasets their audiences are making and then they could use them to further my original analysis. People who are moree technically-oreinted would find the presentation of my work through a Jupyter Notebook most beneficial because as they read through it they may start to develop their own research questions in their heads, and the Jupyter Notebook would allow them to immediately dive into that.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">HTML Website Using Bootstrap</p> 
<p>Another way I would present this data would be through a webpage that is made using Boostrap. A webpage is usually aimed to the general public instead of being more technically-oriented, so this would be for the fans of the show. One thing I think would be cool would be to use the cards feature of Bootstrap and make a card for each player that Survivor has ever had and some background information on them. These cards could be organized by season as well. People would be able to see a background of each player which would help them understand the visuals better. The visuals show players that have won two or three times, but someeone might not be familiar with who whose people are (#fakefan) and could easily see who they are and what they're about. This could also be fun for younger fans because they would be able to go back and see past players that they might not have been able to watch on TV.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">RevealJS</p>
<p>Lastly I could use a RevealJS presentation to represent my work. I would use this method to share my work with TV producers and anyone who is in charge of casting for the show. This way the producers and casting crew could quickly see visuals and an analysis of the visuals, as well as any desciptions about the data. Slide deck presentations usually contain short bullet points that serve as talking points rather than giving all the information away at once. Producers and casting crews are very busy people and this would be a quick way for them to see the main arguments without having to read, and they could listen to the presenter instead of reading paragraphs about the information. I would also use a RevealJS presentaion to present my work my friends or family because I think that would be fun for my family to see. We are big fans of the show and this could be something I display on our TV and force them to listen to because how cool is it that we can learn more about our favorite TV shows through data!</p>
