      <h2>What is Dogecoin and how is it related to carbon dioxide concentrations?</h2>
      <h5>Casey Paul</h5>
      <p>In recent years crypto currencies have started to become more common as more types of cryptocurrencies are created. One specifically is Dogecoin, which was created in late 2013. Another thing that has increased over the years is carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Obviously the two are not related, but maybe there is a correlation between the two. Let’s take a look.</p>
      
      <p>Before this essay I had only heard of Dogecoin and knew it was some sort of cryptocurrency, but I really had no idea what it actually was. According to this article by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/">Forbes</a>, “Software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin in late 2013. Palmer branded the cryptocurrency’s logo using a meme popular at the time that featured the deliberately misspelled word “doge” to describe a Shiba Inu dog.” I remember my freshman year boyfriend thinking that was the funniest meme ever -- it wasn’t. Something that has also increased Dogecoin’s popularity was the recent stock market crisis with r/WallStreetBets, “where enthusiasts had promised to propel its value ‘to the moon’.” The reason behind this is because there is no cap on the number of Docecoins that can be created. Isn't that crazy?</p>

      <p>Above is a line graph depicting the price of Dogecoin in USD from late 2013 to April 25th, 2021. At first glance there is a huge spike in 2021 and this is because of the recent stock market crisis where people were talking about Dogecoin prices going way up. The recent stock market crisis involving r/WallStreetBets happened in late January, and we can see there is a spike around that time period. The largest spike of all begings in early April and has continued to go up. Looking at the history of Dogecoin pricing, there is a small spike in May and June of 2017, however it declines again in August of that year. There are much smaller spikes from April 2018 to around November or December of that year, however, they drop again and stay constant until January of 2021. I am not educated enough in this subject to know what caused the smaller spikes in the past, but I do know why there are many recent spikes in the data. </p>

      <p>Here we see a bar chart showing the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration over the years, starting in 1958 and ending in 2020. At first glance it is clear that the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is slightly increasing every year, leading to an overall increase in carbon dioxide concentration. While each month the concentration of carbon dioxide may fluctuate, there has not been a single year where the concentration of carbon dioxide has decreased; the average concentration for each year has either stayed constant or increased over time. One thing that surprised me was the bar for 2020 CO2 concentrations. I thought this bar would have been much taller or much lower; I did not think it would follow the trend of a slight increase. It could have been much taller because during COVID, many more factories and delivery trucks have been in production and could have contributed to CO2 concentrations more than ever before. I also think it could have been lower because people were not flying or driving places as much due to the pandemic.</p>
      
      <p>Overall we can see that as the prices of Dogecoin increase so does the concentration of  CO2 in our atmosphere. Even though our data does not include the past few years of Dogecoin prices, it is common knowledge that Dogecoin has increased in price recently. Could there be a correlation between the two? Maybe, but probably not. Correlation does not mean causation, and that is clear when comparing two completely different variables. </p>

<p>**Note: I tried to filter the CO2 concentration data to start at 2014-01-01 using a transform and filter so that the axes on both visuals would be the same, but I could not get my visual to load if I did that.**</p>
