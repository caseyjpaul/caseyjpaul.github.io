<h1>Weekly Assignment 2</h1>
<h3>Word Count: 580</h3>
<p>During the week of January 25th, 2021 the stock market was in crisis due to the bizarre trading of GameStop stock organized through the social media platform Reddit. This event calls into question some themes typically discussed in information science such as content moderation, internet ethics, and the power of social networking sites. The events of the past month are by far the largest impact that social media has had on the world to date.</p>

<p>Content moderation is something that is becoming more frequent as well as more difficult to do as people continue to share their lives on social media sites. In the future, monitoring content on social networking sites will need to go beyond fact-checking news articles, censoring inappropriate images, or removing harmful or upsetting conversations, and begin to monitor and anticipate the potential impact of the social communication happening online. In the case of r/WallStreetBets, moderators could have supervised the discussion posts on this subreddit and anticipated what was going to happen. Although social networking sites are already supposed to be monitored by the stock market in an attempt to predict patterns and prices of stock, in this situation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to monitor the activity taking place on all social networking sites that could influence the stock market.</p> 

<p>Internet ethics and privacy is something frequently talked about in information science, and has become more prevalent in recent months (especially leading up to and after the recent presidential election).  There have been several high-profile incidents where social media use has been cut off as content was deemed “unethical” or inaccurate.  This calls for a debate between our First Amendment rights (freedom of speech) and a social media platforms’ responsibility to deliver ethical content.  Was it ethical to allow Reddit users to agree openly to run up the price of GameStop stock knowing fully well the financial impact it would have on the hedge funds that shorted the stock?  Would monitoring that conversation be a violation of privacy?  Last month’s events make for a strong case that conversations need to be monitored in anticipation of potential financial or dangerous impact.</p>  

<p>Lastly, we see the extensive power social media can have on something as big as the stock market. The original goal of social media and social networking sites was to keep people connected when they could not be connected in person. Over time, social media has evolved into more than just connecting with others; it is now frequently used to influence the way people go about their daily lives. Whether it’s altering what products people buy, belief systems they have, or ways they choose to present themselves to the world, social media can affect us in more ways than we know. In this case, social media and social networking sites were used to impact the stock market and the demand for GameStop stock, which ultimately affected hedge funds by billions of dollars. If social media and social networking sites did not exist, there would be no platform for people to go to and make something like this transpire.</p>

<p>It is clear that themes often discussed in information science and data science are prevalent in almost every aspect of society -- even the stock market. With the trading fiasco that took place with GameStop, it is evident that content moderation, internet ethics and privacy, and the power of social medias are all problems that should be taken seriously no matter what the circumstances may be.</p>
