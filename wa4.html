<h2 style="text-align: center;">Do you have a chance at winning Survivor?</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 110%">Casey Paul</p>

<p><em>I chose to write about CBS’s reality TV show <em>Survivor</em> because I have watched this show with my family my whole life. When my family was transferred to live in Europe we still bought seasons of the show on Apple TV so we would not fall behind. My younger brother is even named after one of the final contestants from season 2, Colby Donaldson.</em></p>


<p>On CBS’ reality tv-show <em>Survivor</em>, contestants are put on an island for 39 days and compete against one another in a series of physical and mental challenges for $1 million and the title of “Soul Survivor”. Since the show aired in 2000, there have been a variety of contests on the show differing in age, career path, culture, and chosen game strategy. While there are contestants of all ages, contestants in their 20’s or 30’s will have a higher chance of making it farther in the game and have a shot at winning the title of Soul Survivor.</p>

<p>Looking at all seasons of <em>Survivor</em> and everyone who has played, most winners fall into the age range of 21-30 when they first played. It is clear that the majority of winners are under 25 years-old, however, two specific players break that norm. We can see from the graphic that there have been players that have won twice and even three times. Those players are Rob Mariano (he goes by “Boston Rob” on the show) and Sandra Diaz-Twine, respectively. Something that is interesting is that the first time these iconic survivors played, Boston Rob was 26-years-old and Sandra was 29-years-old. Looking at players who have only won one time, we can see that the dots in the 20-25 age range are the darkest, meaning that more than one winner falls into this age bracket. Another factor that plays into this correlation is that older players usually get voted off first for dragging the tribes down at challenges, causing them to go to tribal council to vote someone off.</p>

<p><em>Survivor</em> encourages people of all ages to play, however, there has been a recent push for younger generations to participate. The reality TV show was popular when it first came out, but over the years and 20 years later, younger generations are turning to reality TV shows like <em>The Bachelor</em> or getting their entertainment from streaming sites like Netflix or Hulu. Considering a lot of <em>Survivor’s</em> fanbase has aged over the 20 years since the show first aired, many people who would want to be on the show may not have the physical ability to play anymore, and therefore will not apply to be on the show. In order to combat this, <em>Survivor</em> has asked younger people to apply and have changed their policy to take applications from people as young as 16-years-old. In their latest promo for season 41, <a href = "https://insidesurvivor.com/suvivor-lowers-its-application-age-limit-to-16-years-old-43992">Jeff Probst stated</a> “You should apply, especially if you’re young. I’m talking teenagers...16, 17, 18, 19. Do it! Cool parents and a cool school, who knows! It could happen.” Clearly <em>Survivor</em> is seeing that younger players make for a more interesting show as they tend to win in the past. Additionally, <em>Survivor</em> is trying to expand their audience so they do not get cancelled.</p>

<p>Something that has changed <em>Survivor</em> gameplay was the introduction of idols and advantages in <a href = "https://www.goldderby.com/feature/survivor-advantages-immunity-idol-fire-tokens-1203342978/">season 11, <em>“Survivor: Guatemala”</a></em>, and have been a fundamental part of the show ever since. In the most recent season of <em>Survivor, “Survivor: Winners at War”</em>, all previous winners were brought together to battle it out. Something that made this season iconic was not only having all of the winners finally playing against each other, but the idea of “old school” vs. “new school” players. “Old School” players can be defined as many things and are generally <a href = "https://survivingtribal.com/2019/06/28/survivor-glossary-old-school-survivor/">characterized by the following:</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>A major focus on the survival aspect of the game</li>
	<li>Constant connections to the culture of the filming location</li>
	<li>Imposing living conditions, pushing castaways to their limit</li>
	<li>Late merges and fewer production twists</li>
	<li>Loyalty and respect are winning standards</li>
	<li>Flipping on an alliance is viewed as pure villainy</li>
	<li>Few to no Hidden Immunity Idols</li>
	<li>Sticking to original tribal lines</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>Winners at War</em>, Old School players were voted off first not for being lazy or for not being smart enough, but for being a threat to New School players. Old School players are less willing to flip on their alliances and understand the game inside and out, whereas <a href = "https://screenrant.com/survivor-new-school-vs-old-school/">New School players play more of a numbers game and focus on jury votes</a>. Given that younger players have more of a New School mindset, this will affect the chances older players have on making it to the end.</p>

<p>Taking everything into account, it can be seen that there are a lot of factors that go into who wins and loses <em>Survivor</em>. By looking at data of past winners, new application policies, and types of gameplay it is clear that younger players have a higher chance of winning.</p>
